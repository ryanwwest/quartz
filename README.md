# ryanwwest instructions

To develop, `fetch-obsidian-blogs-and-build-site.sh` so that hugo-obsidian fetches and transforms (changes wikilinks) the symlinked markdown blog posts in `content/`, then hugo actually builds the static site. Easiest to use my linux box at `x/ryanwwest.com/` which nginx is serving as the local staging environment for the site. 

View  [[config.toml]] for some configurations and [[data/config.yaml]] for others, layouts/partials/giscus.html for comment system. But in reality, I've tweaked so many things in partials/ and css that ctrl-f is the best.
